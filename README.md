# Dinner and a Movie!

## User Story:
```
GIVEN that I am a user in self-quarantine.
AND I want to simulate a night out by having custom food and entertainment options presented to me.
THEN I enter my zipcode to enable a local search.
THEN I search for a movie title by name OR by genre.
IF I submit a title then I am shown the movie’s data and options for its streaming location.
IF I choose a genre from the dropdown menu, then a random movie in that genre is selected for me.
THEN three local restaurants capable of delivery or ready for pickup are paired with my movie through a custom search and links are provided to the restaurants’ webpages.
